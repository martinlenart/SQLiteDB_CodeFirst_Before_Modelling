1. Compile and Run SeidoApplication. 
	- The Configuration Directory is shown on the console
	- First time you run the program make sure to copy the file "DbConnects.json" to the DbConnections Directory
	- "DbConnections.json"contains the Database connection string

2. After you have copied the "DbConnections.json", re-run the program
	- Your should have the Database Connection String as output on the console

3. Create the DataModel by uncommenting the regions marked "Uncomment to create the Data model" in:
	- SeidoDemoModels: Customer.cs, Order.cs
	- SeidoDemoDb: SeidoDemoDbContext.cs

5. ReBuild an Run the project. Output to the Console should be the Database connection string

4. Open PMC and ensure that the Class Library, SeidoDemoDb, is the default project (On Mac open a terminal in SeidoDemoDb directory).
5. In PMC, type below command to migrate the Datamodel into Database: 
	add-migration initial_migration (in macOS: dotnet ef migrations add initial_migration)
6. The migration should be successful and you can view the changes in project SeidoDemoDb in a folder named Migrations 

7. To undo the migration as it has not been committed to the database in PMC do
	remove-migration  (in macOS: dotnet ef migrations remove)
8. You will see the Migration folder disappear as it was the first migration

9. Redo the migration by typing in PMC
	add-migration initial_migration (in macOS: dotnet ef migrations add initial_migration)
10. Commit to the Database by typing in PMC
	update-database  (in macOS: dotnet ef database update) 

11. Open DBeaver to check the newly created SQLite Database called SeidoDemo_SQLite.db
	- Order and Customer Tables and ForeignKey contraints linking and Order with Customer should have been created

12. Populate the database by uncommenting the regions marked "Uncomment to seed and query the Database" in:
	- SeidoDemoModels: Customer.cs, Order.cs
	- SeidoApplication: Program.cs

13. Compile and run the program to seed the database. The Console output should after each run show Nr of Customers 
    and Nr of Orders in the Database

14. Run the program a few times to see the database content increase
